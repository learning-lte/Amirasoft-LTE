= To install Amarisoft LTE 2015-10-28 =
========================================

1) Introduction
---------------

    * This script will install Amarisoft components (eNB, MME, MBMSGW, WWW and
        OTS tools).

    * Components will be installed under /root/ (See 3 to change it) except WWW
        that will be placed in /var/www/html (Fedora) or /var/www (Ubuntu).

    * The OTS installation will create a service that will launch the software
        automatically at startup (See 4).

    * For OTS and/or WWW, you should have an internet connection available as
        install.sh script will try to install new packages.

    * Note that after installation, you'll need to update your configuration
        files (enb.cfg, mme.cfg...) manually.


2) Prerequisite
---------------

    * You have already installed once Amarisoft LTE softwares using
        documentation (This won't install UHD drivers) or you have an OTS
        installation.

    * You must be root.

    * You need (Fedora >= 19) or Ubuntu (>= 12.04) Linux distribution.


3) Procedure
------------

    Remove tarballs (<file>.tar.gz) you dont want to install from this directory.

    Then execute install.sh with root access.

    By default, softwares are installed in /root, you can choose other
    destination by specifying first parameter:
        ./install.sh <path>


4) OTS
------

    The OTS service will start LTE components (If present): eNB, MME and MBMS.
    Here is how you can handle them manually:

    Fedora:
        You can start/stop all components with those commands (as root):
        > service lte stop
        > service lte start

        If you have changed a config file, you just need:
        > service lte restart

        To disable service start at boot time:
        > systemctl disable lte

        To enable service start at boot time:
        > systemctl enable lte

    Ubuntu:
        You can start/stop all components with those commands:
        > sudo /etc/init.d/lte.d stop
        > sudo /etc/init.d/lte.d start

        If you have changed a config file, you just need:
        > sudo /etc/init.d/lte.d restart

    Default configuration file can be found at: /etc/ltestart.conf.
    Please don't change it as it will be overriden at next release install.
    However, you can override configuration by creating following file:
        /root/.lte

    To access components monitors, use screen command:
        > screen -x lte

    Inside screen, you can switch between component windows by typing:
        ctrl+a <window>

    By default:
        ctrl+a 0 => MME
        ctrl+a 1 => eNB
        ctrl+a 2 => MBMS

        ctrl+a <space> will switch to next window

    eNB:
        The eNB software is started with /root/enb/config/enb.cfg file by default
        => To update config, replace this file (or create a symlink) and restart lte service

    MME:
        The MME software is started with /root/mme/config/mme.cfg file by default
        => To update config, replace this file (or create a symlink) and restart lte service


5) WWW
------

    You will have access to Web tool on this URL:
        http://<my IP>/lte/


6) TRX
------

    You may have been provided a specific TRX driver for eNB.
    If so, this installation process will update eNB configuration
    and trx driver.
    This imply your hardware is compatible with the TRX version.
