1. GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE

1.1 Licenses For each license that you acquire to use the Product, you will be provided
with a License Certificate (a "License Certificate"), which may be either a certificate, the
installation and licensing instructions, your invoice, or an activation file and which may be
provided to you either with the Product media or separately by AMARISOFT or its
authorized distributors or resellers. The License Certificate will contain information specific
to the Product, the type of license under which you may use the Product and the number
of licenses that you have acquired. In order to activate and use the Product as set forth in
this License Agreement, you must follow the instructions when prompted by the Product.
The type of license you may acquire is a CPU License, all defined in this Section 1 of this
License Agreement. Unless your License Certificate identifies your acquisition of another
license type, you have acquired a CPU License. For more information on which license
types, if any, should be included with the Product media you should contact AMARISOFT
or your AMARISOFT authorized distributor or reseller.

1.2 CPU Grant of License The terms of this Section 1.2 are applicable to you only if you
have purchased a CPU License, as defined below, for the Product directly from
AMARISOFT or a AMARISOFT authorized distributor or reseller. Subject to the terms and

to permit multiple CPU to use the Product (each, a "CPU License"). The foregoing CPU
Licenses shall be for access and use, only by the equivalent number of CPU for whom you
have paid the applicable license fees and obtained a License Key Certificate. The Product
may be used exclusively by the specifically designated CPU, subject to all the terms and
conditions of this License Agreement. You agree that you will not designate more CPU
than the number of CPU Licenses that AMARISOFT or a AMARISOFT authorizeddistributor or
reseller has expressly granted to you and you will not allow the Product to be
used by any CPU other than the CPU designated by you from time to time. Subject to the
other terms and conditions of this License, you may make a reasonable number of copies

physical CD media backup copy of the Product solely to replace the original copy provided
to you if the original copy is damaged or destroyed. All rights not specifically granted to you
herein are retained by AMARISOFT.
